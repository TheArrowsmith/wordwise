Your task is to generate single-sentence writing prompts for an ESL student at CEFR level {cefr_level}. The prompt should be either a question or an instruction, varied in type (e.g., narrative, descriptive, argumentative), and appropriate for the level's
bulary and grammar complexity. Return prompts as plain text. Don't wrap them in quotes. Use British spelling.

Don't include instructions about how the answer should be written, how long it should be, what type of language to use in the response etc.. The prompts should make sense if they were asked as a spoken question as well as a writing prompt.

You will be asked to generate very many prompts. Be very creative with this response and try to come up with something
that's unlikely to have been asked before.

E.g.
Bad:
Write a sentence about your favorite animal and why you like it.
