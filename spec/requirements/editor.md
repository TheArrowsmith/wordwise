Text Editor Implementation

- [ ] Install and configure Draft.js with basic formatting toolbar
- [ ] Set up Draft.js editor with bold, italic, and list formatting options
- [ ] Implement 500ms debounce for text input using use-debounce
- [ ] Create Next.js API route for OpenAI text analysis
- [ ] Implement error highlighting with red underlines
   - [ ] Apply `ERROR_RED` inline style for errors (CSS: `text-decoration: underline red`).
- [ ] Handle OpenAI API response parsing for errors and fluency suggestions
- [ ] Writing feedback requests ONLY trigger when text actually changes, not repeatedly
- [ ] Feedback remains consistent - once received for specific text, it doesn't change until text is modified
- [ ] Prevent feedback from rewriting itself with slightly different wording for the same errors
- [ ] Use 'prompts/generate_writing_prompt.txt' to generate a new writing prompt when requested.
- [ ] Autosaving:
  - [ ] When I make my first edit to the blank editor, a new document is saved to the backend.
  - [ ] The document is automatically saved again on subsequent edits.
  - [ ] To prevent overloading the backend, auto-saving is throttled so we save at most once per second.
  - [ ] When an autosave is triggered, the text 'Saving...' appears. When autosave completes, this changes to 'Saved'.
  - [ ] Autosave ONLY triggers when actual content changes occur, not in loops
  - [ ] Autosave stops after saving and doesn't continue indefinitely
- [ ] Implement auto-save to Supabase documents table on each debounced change
- [ ] Store document metadata: content, prompt_id, cefr_level, prompt_type, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] Handle API failures gracefully (show "Feedback unavailable" message)
- [ ] Typed text in textarea is readable (sufficient contrast between text and background)
- [ ] Fix authentication issue with API routes by implementing proper server-side Supabase client with request headers and adding auth tokens to frontend fetch calls
- [ ] Text editor allows normal typing without erasing characters as user types
